# productLandingProjectFCC
Submission for the Product Landing Page project for freecodecamp.org. I spend a large part of my summer fiddling with this, trying to get it just right. I even went as far to use AI to generate images, make and alter ones I found online. But it was fun and the effort was worth it as this is one my favorite works.
